# Kubernetes Lab Tutorial
**Kubernetes** is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across a cluster of hosts. This tutorial is for personal use only. It's just a lab guide for teaching the main concepts in a scripted way. Never consider it as a reference for Kubernets. Please go to the project [docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs) for more details about what Kubernets is and how does it work.
